Data Visualization of Covid 19

In this project, I analyzed the data of the COVID-19 pandemic, which started in the first month of 2020 and still continues to affect the world. 
The purpose wasn't to produce a comprehensive analysis of the topic but to present my visualization skills.

I used data from https://www.kaggle.com/code/imdevskp/covid-19-analysis-visualization-comparisons#Composition-of-Cases

This dataset cointains information from the period 22.01-27.07.20 of different case types, countries, WHO regions.

## 1. Firstly we made data visualizations using Plotly.

We created different type of graphs: 

-treemap, 

-area graph, 

-line graph, 

-scatter plot,

-choropleth map,

-bar graph,

-pie chart, 

-sunburst chart, 

-histogram,

-box plot.



The graphs were made for 6 groups: 

-Basic Statistics, 

-World Statistics, 

-WHO Region Statistics,

-Top 10 Affected Countries Statistics, 

-WHO Region-Europe Statistics, 

-Poland Statistics.



Under some graphs you can find example conclusions which can be drawn from this visualization.



## 2. Next, using the visualization, we prepared a dashboard about Covid 19.

It is a multi-page dashboard with three pages: World, WHO Region and Others.

The app has been deployed on Heroku and is visible here: http://agnieszkaszewczyk.pythonanywhere.com/apps/world
